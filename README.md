# PokeParetoSS
Pareto efficiency analysis of Pokemon Sword/Shield final forms

All centered around [this notebook](https://github.com/drsaunders/PokeParetoSS/blob/main/PokeParetoSS.ipynb), but it doesn't look very good in preview without interactive tables and plotly plots, so strongly suggest only looking at it in a live notebook.
